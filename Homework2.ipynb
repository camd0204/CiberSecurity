Another important con of hash funtions is the lack of encrypting nature found in encrypting algorithms, not being able to provide data confidentiality."

    "The process of generating and verifying a MAC involves agreeing on a shared secret key between the sender and receiver through a secure key exchange mechanism. Once the key is established, the sender uses a MAC algorithm, such as HMAC with a chosen hash function like SHA-256, to process the message and generate an authentication tag of a fixed length. This authentication tag, which serves as a cryptographic checksum, is then appended to the message and sent to the receiver over a potentially insecure channel. Upon receiving the tagged message, the receiver extracts the authentication tag and the original message. \n",
    "Using the shared secret key and the agreed-upon MAC algorithm, the receiver computes a new authentication tag for the received message. The critical step involves comparing the computed authentication tag with the one sent by the sender. If the tags match, the message is verified as authentic, indicating that it has not been tampered with during transmission, and the sender is considered authentic. In cases where the tags do not match, the receiver may choose to reject the message or take appropriate action based on the security protocol in place. While MACs provide integrity and authenticity, additional encryption measures should be considered for confidentialit. The entire security of this process hinges on the secure exchange of the secret key and the robustness of the chosen MAC algorithm."

    "In the realm of secure communication, Message Authentication Codes (MACs) act as essential safeguards for messages. Picture them as digital security measures ensuring that when you send a message, it reaches its destination without any unauthorized changes. Each message is assigned a unique tag or code, similar to a secret identifier. This code allows the recipient to check the message's integrity, much like sealing an envelope to protect its contents. MACs also serve to confirm the legitimacy of the sender. Only the authorized individual possessing a specific key can generate the correct tag, functioning as a secure password of sorts. This helps prevent the occurrence of fraudulent messages pretending to be from someone else. MACs further contribute to non-repudiation, offering cryptographic proof of the message's origin and preventing the sender from disavowing their involvement. Through the use of special codes and timestamps, MACs also deter replay attacks, where someone attempts to resend the same message. In simpler terms, MACs function as digital safeguards, ensuring that messages are secure, authentic, and genuinely from the intended sender."

PKI ensures the confidentiality of emails by facilitating encryption with the recipient's public key, safeguarding the content during transmission. By using PKI, it addresses the challenge of authenticating the sender through the use of digital certificates, allowing recipients to verify the legitimacy of the email source. This authentication aspect contributes to user trust, as individuals can rely on visual indicators, such as digital signatures, to confirm the security of their email communication. PKI assists in mitigating security concerns related to untrusted networks, ensuring that even if emails traverse potentially insecure channels, the content remains confidential and protected.
